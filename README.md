1.) Introduction 
   --------------------------------
   
The MiniRogue game was created for an introductory CS course, and it uses character-based graphics. In this game, the player's objective is to find a golden idol while navigating a series of dungeons. The player will run into monsters, find items, and descend staircases during the journey. 

The MiniRogue dungeon is 5 levels deep. When the game starts, the player is placed on level 0; the deepest level is level 4.
At the start of a new game and every time the player takes a stairway down, a new level is randomly generated.

2.) Results 
   -------------------
   
The player is shown on screen as an **@**.

The different types of monsters that you may encounter and their corresponding symbols are below:

Bogeymen (shown on screen as a **B**)\
Dragons (shown on screen as a **D**)\
Goblins (shown on screen as a **G**)\
Snakewomen (shown on screen as an **S**)

The different types of objects you may encounter are below:

Impenetrable walls (shown on screen as **#**)\
Stairways down to the next level (shown on screen as **>**)\
The golden idol (shown on screen as **&**)\
Weapons (all weapons are shown on screen as a **)** character)\
Maces\
Short swords\
Long swords\
Magic fangs of sleep (that put an opponent to sleep)\
Magic axes (that hit an opponent more often than regular weapons)\
Scrolls (all scrolls are shown on screen as **?**)\
A scroll of teleportation (when read, randomly moves the player)\
A scroll of improve armor (when read, makes it harder for monsters to hit the player)\
A scroll of raise strength (when read, makes a player's blows more effective)\
A scroll of enhance health (when read, raises maximum hit points)\
A scroll of enhance dexterity (when read, makes it more likely the player will hit an opponent)

3.) What I Learned
   ------------

During this project, I applied many fundamental CS concpets to create a playable game. Some of the concepts I incorporated include but are not limited to: classes, constructors, destructors, inheritance, polymorphism, recursion, and function time-complexity.
